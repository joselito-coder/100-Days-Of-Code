# 100 days of code

- Hey I will be practicing 100 days of code making 100 projects 
- I will create them in next js

I am following a [blog](https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/100-days-100-projects/) that I found online when I tried searching `100 days of code` on google 
- I will be following and recreating the projects that [florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17/100Days100Projects) created
